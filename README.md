> Webpages that just look like linear

Hardly any SaaS website doesn't look similar to linear.app anymore. In recent months, this "copying" has increased so much that lists can now be created.
Likelinear is a list of websites that have a visual similarity to Linear.
For contribution look down below. I am happy about every new site that I can add to the list.

I plan to create a design library with components for React (or other frameworks) that have this linear touch. If you are a designer and/or programmer, please contact me!

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by adding more websites that fit the likelinear aesthetic and open an issue with the template "‚ú® Website suggestion".
I plan to create a design library (like [shadncn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)) with components for React (other frameworks are also welcome) that have this "linear touch". If you are a designer and/or programmer and would like to start such a project, please contact me!

If the design of a website has changed, a website is offline or there are other problems with a list entry, please open an issue with the template "‚ùå Remove website".
